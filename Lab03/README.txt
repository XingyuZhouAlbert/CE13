Name: Xingyu Zhou. I basically work on every single lab alone but I would love to find some partners.

I couldn¡¯t figure out the MatrixInverse part, so I choose not to include it in my matrixmath.c. Also, I hard coded indexes for the MatrixDet part which is different from what the lab manual tells me to do since I don¡¯t know how to implement that method. What¡¯s more, in my own mml.c I defined two arrays called ¡°result2¡± and ¡°result3¡±, they are used and only used for the MatrixMult functions. Besides that everything follows the lab manual.

Before I start the lab, I will usually read the lab manual first. If the manual tells me to do additional reading, I will do it as well. Then I will divide the whole lab into several pieces and finish them one by one. This strategy has been working for me for a long time so I don¡¯t think anything could go wrong so far. If I need to do it again, I would probably follow the same procedures. As for the collaboration part, I don¡¯t have a partner. When it comes to coding I often find myself not being able to sufficiently express my opinions due to my language efficiency. So I don¡¯t think people will want to work with someone who can¡¯t express themselves correctly.

There are 9 functions in total and I ended up finishing 8 of them. I spend maybe more than 25 hours on it and I can¡¯t say I like it but I don¡¯t hate it. It¡¯s like a regular lab to me. I think every lab is worthwhile since it helps me gain new knowledge and practise my coding skill. The hardest part for me is how to express correctly with C. I have to read a lot of books besides the one provided to help me better understand it. The lab manual could use a little bit more example and more teaching on the concepts in labs also helps a lot.
