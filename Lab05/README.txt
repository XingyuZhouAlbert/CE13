My name is Xingyu Zhou and I worked with my own on this lab.
For this lab I implemented a series of linkedlist functions and their test codes. The important aspect should be understanding how the doubly linked list works since I can¡¯t implement the function without knowing anything about it.

The approach of this lab is kind of different from before. The reading part is the same but when I was implementing the functions, those lecture videos really helped me a lot. I was able to follow the procedures provided during the lecture and implemented some perfectly working functions. Due to the strike I was unable to get help for the first two days and I kept getting this runtime exception error. I tried several different methods (most of the time just guessing) and finally found a way to fix it but I still didn¡¯t know why it worked. Other than that, everything was fine.

The lab ended up working just fine. I spent probably around 20 hours on this lab. I could¡¯ve spent more time on it so that I can fully understand the concepts but since I have a midterm on Friday I have to make time for the review sessions. However, I don¡¯t think it¡¯s necessary to have a official test code for every lab since when I¡¯m testing I will just write some simple test code but now I have to make it look more official, which could potentially take more time. But testing is still an important skill. I would love to hear professor talk more about the lab during the lecture since it really helps.
