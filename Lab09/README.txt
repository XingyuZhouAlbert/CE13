Collaboration:
I did Field and FieldTest.c. Mingyu Ding did Protocol and ProtocolTest.c and we both work on Artificial Agent .c (even though we can¡¯t finish it).

Summary:
For this lab we are creating a Battleship game and make a Artificial opponent to play against with. The state machine of Artificial Agent and Protocol are probably the most important part of this lab. The lab manual is ok, I was able to implement most of the functions based on the manual (even though for Field.c there wasn¡¯t much thing in the manual).

Approach:
As usual, I started by reading through the whole lab manual. After I noticed that I couldn¡¯t understand what exactly Protocol is doing, I decided to go for Field and let my partner handled Protocol since he got better grade and probably smarter than me. Then I went straight to implementing the Field.c. The most difficult part for me in Field.c was the FieldAddBoat(). I basically hardcoded every boat in every direction in that function since that was the most straightforward way for me. The rest of the functions were ok and I tested them out without any difficulties. Then it was the Artificial Agent state machine. Since my partner hasn¡¯t finished protocol by the time I was done, I went ahead and started implementing the state machine on my own. I was stuck on the SEND_GUESS_DATA state for so long and we still couldn¡¯t finish it at the end. The teamwork was very fun and we had plenty of communications to make sure that we can understand what each of us was doing. If I were to do it again, I might be focusing more on the Protocol part, especially the Protocol decode.

Outcome:
We ended up not finishing the lab. There was a very strange bug in our code that we¡¯ve spent a whole day and still couldn't find out. On Friday¡¯s lab we were able to get our code running based on the HumanAgent.o provided. But when we came back from lunch and decided to work on the Hit marker issue, the code just stopped working. Whenever we hit a boat, the enemy would just output ¡°Parsing_error¡±. Since it was the identical code and we didn¡¯t even change anything, it was nearly impossible for us to locate the bug. After countless tries, we finally gave up. It was too much to do for a single lab even with a partner. I spent more than 40 hours in it and I could¡¯ve spent more but I have other homework to do. In general, it¡¯s still too much even just for a partnered lab (also it¡¯s on a week before final which make it more difficult to spend all the time in it).
The grading seems appropriate.
