The time goes faster than it should be but I don¡¯t really know how to fix it.

The most important part of the lab is to understand how state machine works. Once I got the hang of it, I was able to implement all the functionalities of the toaster oven. It took me a while but it was worth it.

My approach to this lab was to read the lab manual and the required reading first. Things went well as I was doing the lab except I didn¡¯t finish it until the last minute. Working with other students will definitely help me with the lab but in order to better understand the concept I need to work on my own(sometimes).

The lab ended up ok. I was kind of rush in the last second and I didn¡¯t have time to optimize some of the codes such as drawing the oven and lightup the leds. This lab was fun and I like it.
The lab manual was helpful especially the chart of how we should implement this state machine.
