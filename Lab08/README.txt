I DIDN'T FINISH THE LAB.
My oled keeps outputting wierd stuff when I press BTN4 and I just can't figure out why. My brain is damaged.

My name is Xingyu Zhou and for this lab I worked with Jimmy Chen and Chin Ming Ryan Wong.

For this lab is really important to understand how the recursion works. I was able to finish some of the functions quick enough since they were related to something that I have done in the previous lab. Although there isn’t enough info in the lab manual to start the recursion but I was slowly getting to know it better throughout the process of implementing the function.

First I started by reading the materials and the lecture videos about the recursion. I started this lab on Sunday but since there was no lab sections on Monday I was stuck on treecreate on fairly amount of time. I started to write other functions such as MorseCheckEvents() and GetChilds() since they were relatively easier and didn't require recursion.Working with others on this lab was extremely helpful. Although I was not be able to finish this lab but I still learned different ways to fix some of the problems. 
I didn't finish the lab. I was able to finish the first helper function but I still didn't understand how append characters work. I spent more than 20 hours on it and actually I was kind of like this lab. The hardest part for me were TreeCreate and the helper functions. The grading seems reasonable and the discussion was definitely helpful. 

Huge thanks for TA MaxL!!
